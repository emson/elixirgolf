## Instructions

Use your **elixir** coding skills to create a Christmas tree.

Your code should create a **triangle** of `0` characters that is `9` rows high.
At the top of the tree should be a **star** `*` and at the bottom there should be
a **trunk** `H`. The star and trunk should be aligned, and the start should be
directly above the top of the tree. The start and trunk are addional rows,
therefore the entire tree is a total of `11` characters high.

Every row of the triangle should be properly indented, such that each row is
centred on the row above.
For example:

{% highlight elixir %}
iex> --enter your code here--
        *
        0
       000
      00000
     0000000
    000000000
   00000000000
  0000000000000
 000000000000000
00000000000000000
        H
{% endhighlight %}

The solution that completes this puzzle with the shortest number of characters
wins. However if you want to get creative you will get an honourable mention.
